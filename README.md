# ePortfolio

## CS499 Computer Science Capstone T4251

## Overview

The steps I took to create my ePortfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project are documented in this repository. One of the best visual communication tools to convey our value to potential employers is to build a professional portfolio that highlights our special skills and abilities. The information in the ePortfolio serves as a good foundation for articulating concepts that highlight my abilities across the major areas of computer science. The accompanying artifacts from some of the computer science program classes show how I've improved in the crucial areas of software engineering, algorithms, and databases.

The selected artifacts have been improved and made available as program practice in addition to meeting the course criteria, demonstrating a high level of effort, correcting any faults or inconsistencies, and reducing vulnerabilities. My portfolio demonstrates that I have a degree in computer science and am a highly motivated, disciplined, and skilled software developer.

### Self-Reflections

[Journal: Self-Introduction](CS499/Journal-Self-Introduction.pdf "Journal: Self-Introduction")

This essay serves as a helpful self-introduction that connects the concepts learned in computer science class to my personal experiences. It means expressing unique viewpoints and interacting more fully and critically with the course subjects and materials. It also lists some new projects that I intend to work on as a software developer in the future.

[Journal: Career Choice](CS499/Journal-Career-Choice-and-Artifact-Update.pdf "Journal: Career Choice")

When I thought back on my decision to pursue a career in software development, I realized that while initially I thought it might be interesting to learn new technologies and use my creativity, the industry is now offering a career path with countless options, advancement, and, depending on how well you do, respectable income. This is what I decided to write about in this paper.

As I approach the culmination of my computer science degree, I can't help but reflect on the incredible journey of the past few years. The program has not only equipped me with a robust understanding of programming languages, algorithms, and software development but has also fostered a mindset of continuous learning and problem-solving.

One of the most significant takeaways from my computer science journey is the ability to approach complex challenges systematically. From tackling intricate coding assignments to collaborating on team projects, I've honed my skills in breaking down problems into manageable components and devising efficient solution.

### Eportfolio Selection and Refinement Plan

This is the document that indicated the plan I used to finish my e-portfolio and demonstrate how my experience at Southern New Hampshire University has helped me progress as a software developer. The artifacts I've selected fall into the three categories of software design and engineering, data structures & algorithms, and databases.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

This document shows the initial improvement made for the first category. As part of my final project, I chose to use an artifact produced for the CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming course.

### Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement

This document details the initial improvement made for the second category, for which I chose to use an artifact from the CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming course as part of my final project. The plan I develop to improve the application will be detailed in the paper.

### Databases Enhancement

This document, which is a component of my final project, shows the initial improvement that has been made for this third category. I made the decision to use an artifact that had been finished for CS-340 Client/Server Development.
Salvare Search for Rescue App is an artifact.

[Databases](CS499/databases.pdf)

### Initial Code Reviews

For any project, code reviews are essential. The code project states that "code review, commonly known as peer review, is systematic analysis of computer source code. It looks to find and fix faults that were overlooked during the first development stage with the intention of improving both the general quality of software and the developers' skills. I like taking part in code reviews because I get to give and receive feedback in addition to seeing how many people tackle the same topic. Getting feedback on my code has helped me become a better software engineer by pointing out common mistakes and weaknesses.
