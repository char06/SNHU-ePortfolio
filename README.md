## CS499 Computer Science Capstone T4251

## Overview

The steps I took to create my ePortfolio for the CS499 Computer Science Capstone course final project are documented in this repository. One of the best visual communication tools to convey our value to potential employers is to build a professional portfolio that highlights our special skills and abilities. The information in the ePortfolio serves as a good foundation for articulating concepts that highlight my abilities across the major areas of computer science. The accompanying artifacts from some of the computer science program classes show how I've improved in the crucial areas of software engineering, algorithms, and databases.

The selected artifacts have been improved and made available as program practice in addition to meeting the course criteria, demonstrating a high level of effort, correcting any faults or inconsistencies, and reducing vulnerabilities. My portfolio demonstrates that I have a degree in computer science and am a highly motivated, disciplined, and skilled software developer.
