## Welcome 

This electronic portfolio combines the knowledge and abilities I've gained while pursuing a degree in computer science at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). A software engineer portfolio is among the most crucial ways for developers to showcase their personalities, design concepts, and coding abilities to prospective clients and employers in order to secure a job in software engineering. This portfolio will give employers actual examples of the tasks i have completed, proving to them that I amÂ capable of the tasks specified on my resume.
