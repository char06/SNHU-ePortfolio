## Welcome 

This electronic portfolio combines the knowledge and abilities I've gained while pursuing a degree in computer science at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). The ePortfolio was created using professional-level written and visual communication that highlights my skills and abilities in a coordinated, technically sound manner that is appropriately targeted at a specific professional audience.
