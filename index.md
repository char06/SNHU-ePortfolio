## Welcome 

This ePortfolio combines the knowledge and skills I've developed over the course of my years of study in Southern New Hampshire University's Computer Science Bachelors degree. 

A software engineer portfolio is among the most crucial ways for developers to showcase their personalities, design concepts, and coding abilities to prospective clients and employers in order to secure a job in software engineering. 

This portfolio will give employers actual examples of the tasks i have completed, proving to them that I am capable of the tasks specified on my resume.
