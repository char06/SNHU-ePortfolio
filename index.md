## Enhancements 

Software design is a critical aspect of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves converting user requirements into a format that can be easily implemented using a programming language. The software design phase is the first step in the SDLC that shifts the focus from the problem domain to the solution domain. As a software engineer, my objective is to construct a web application using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, with the help of the open-source, cross-platform runtime environment Node.js. In this report, I present a list of enhancements to improve the software design of the web application based on the wireframe that I created.

<div style="text-align: center;">
       <img src="assests/wireframe.png" width="720px" title="CS-499">
       <p><em>Figure 3 - Eventify Enhancement Wireframe - CS499 Computer Science Capstone</em></p>
</div>

- User-Centered Design: The wireframe provides a basic structure of the web application. To improve the software design, the user interface should be developed with a user-centered design approach that considers the user's needs, goals, and preferences. This can be achieved by conducting user research, creating user personas, and designing user flows that align with the user's journey.
- Modularity: In software design, the system is viewed as a collection of parts or modules with distinct behaviors. To improve the modularity of the web application, the code should be organized into smaller, reusable modules that can be easily maintained and updated. 
- Implement more CRUD functionality: Currently, the app only has basic CRUD functionality. To make it more robust, additional CRUD actions could be added, such as filtering and sorting data, searching, and pagination.
- Improve software architecture: Although the essential features of the application have been developed, there may be room for improvement in terms of the overall structure of the app. It may be worth revisiting the architecture and identifying any areas that can be optimized or streamlined for better performance and scalability.
- Enhance user interface: While the user interface's logic has been started, there is still much room for improvement to ensure that the application is intuitive and user-friendly. The user interface could be enhanced by adding more interactive elements, better visual design, and more responsive behavior.

       <p><em>Figure 3 - New Eventify look - CS499 Computer Science Capstone</em></p>
</div>

- Security: The web application should be designed with security in mind to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. To improve security, the software design should include encryption of sensitive data, secure authentication mechanisms, and regular security audits.
- Add user authentication and authorization: To make the application more secure, it could benefit from adding user authentication and authorization features. This could involve implementing a login system and role-based access control to ensure that users only have access to the appropriate parts of the appwireframe
- Implement additional functionality using middleware: Node.js offers several middleware libraries that can be used to add functionality to the app. For example, body-parser can be used to parse incoming request bodies, and cookie-parser can be used to parse cookies.
- Implement additional routes: As mentioned, Node.js doesn't handle routing natively, so using a web framework like Express can simplify the process. Consider adding additional routes to handle various HTTP actions and URL paths.
- Improve static file serving: While Express does include a built-in static file server, there are additional options available that offer more advanced features, such as caching and compression.
- Use a template engine: Express offers several popular template engines, such as Pug and EJS, that can be used to dynamically construct responses. Consider using a template engine to simplify the process of rendering dynamic content.

In conclusion, the software design phase is a critical aspect of the SDLC that involves converting user requirements into a format that can be easily implemented using a programming language. To improve the software design of the web application, enhancements should be made to ensure a user-centered design, modularity, scalability, and security. By implementing these enhancements, the web application will be better equipped to meet user needs and ensure a high-quality user experience.
